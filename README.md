# pch: Internal mesh library used for convenience with Maya plug-ins
===========================================================================

## What is it?

  - `pch` is a "polyCache" C++ library to work with meshes in Maya and Houdini.
  - This is a CMake adaptation of my earlier attempt, cleaned up and generalized for other use cases.
  - It was created a while ago, so this is a very old code that shoul've been refactored ages ago.
